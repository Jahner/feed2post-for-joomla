Fixes for content bug
Added zoo 2.5 engine and marked the previous one for zoo 2.4 (both zoo24 and zoo25 engines are available now, pick the right one)

Added the option to stop processing the article when the "cut at lenght" or the "cut at tag" has been reached (truncating an article)

Fixed magpie's fetch, changed to use php_curl as the exec function is not always available. Now works with secure servers with exec disabled trying to fetch ssl feeds.

08/08/2012 -- V3.0Rc 10
New:
 * K2 support as storage engine (BETA);
 * Image downloading (so it stops hotlinking and get's a local cache) 
 * Keyword extraction from the article.
     Keyword extraction will use a "max keyword count" parameter to stop adding keywords after the number has been reached and "Min keyword len" to avoid the short keywords 
     (Which are also bad for seo, like "if", "at", "on", etc.).
 * Bugfix:
    For twitter parser that was not possible to set the pin after the first "save".

25/09/2012 -- V3.0Rc 10b
* Bugfix: Meta description for joomla content was not urldecoded.
